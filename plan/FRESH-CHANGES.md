### Revision: Centralized Proxy Linkage Engine (Stage 1 Refactor)
**Date:** 2026-09-03 12:10 (EDT)
**Context:** Modularize proxy entity lifecycle management, orientation sync, spatial destruction, space platform building, and GUI opening handlers to eliminate duplicated prototype event listeners.
**Key Changes:**
1. **Centralized Proxy Engine (`scripts/proxy-manager.lua`):** Created a registry-based engine (`proxy_manager.register_pair`) that centrally listens to build, destruction, rotation, flip, cloning, and GUI opening events, managing hidden circuit proxies dynamically.
2. **Device Registration (`scripts/proxy-manager.lua`):** Registered default circuit proxy specifications for `pneumatic-pump` and `pneumatic-diverter`, delegating GUI opening directly to `pump_gui.open` and `diverter_gui.open`.
3. **Control Entry Point Cleanup (`control.lua`):** Deprecated individual linkage script imports (`pneumatic-diverter-proxy-linkage.lua` and `pneumatic-pump-proxy-linkage.lua`) and initialized the central engine via `proxy_manager.register_events()`.
