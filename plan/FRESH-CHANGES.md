### Revision: Unpowered Pump Flow Culling & Vector Gating
**Context:** Prevent unpowered pumps from acting as passive flow sinks that trap moving capsules on dead-end inlet paths or adjacent multi-port entity branches when pump power is disconnected.
**Key Changes:**
1. **Power State Evaluation (`scripts/networks/networks-flow.lua`):** Implemented an `is_pump_powered()` validation helper to check `storage.pump_power_states` for `pneumatic-pump` entities prior to hop construction.
2. **Internal Transfer Gating (`scripts/networks/networks-flow.lua`):** Restricted internal machine transfer hop generation across pump ports so unpowered pumps suppress internal transfers between inlet and outlet ports.
3. **External Vector Flow Gating (`scripts/networks/networks-flow.lua`):** Enforced power state validation on both source and destination entities during outbound hop calculation, preventing pressure-gradient vector creation into unpowered pump inlets.
4. **Dead-End Pruning Integration (`scripts/networks/networks-flow.lua`):** Suppressing unpowered pump hops allows `flow-cull.lua` to naturally identify and prune dead-end internal junction paths leading toward unpowered inlets.

### Revision: Specialized Transit Capsule Prototypes & Tech Tree Integration
**Date:** 2026-08-26 21:25 (EDT)
**Context:** Register item prototypes, crafting recipes, and technology research nodes for specialized transit capsule variants (biodegradable, refrigerated, reinforced, and player transit) ahead of runtime mechanics integration.
**Key Changes:**
1. **Capsule Variant Items (`prototypes/item.lua`):** Registered item prototypes for `biodegradable-capsule`, `refrigerated-capsule`, `reinforced-capsule`, and `player-transit-capsule` with stack size 1 and distinct order sub-keys (`a[capsule]-b[...]` through `e[...]`) under the `intermediate-product` subgroup.
2. **Variant Crafting Recipes (`prototypes/recipe.lua`):** Added recipe definitions for all four new capsule variants with `enabled = false` for tech unlock gating, establishing crafting times (1.0s to 5.0s) and ingredients matching tier progression.
3. **Technology Unlocks & Tree Expansion (`prototypes/technology.lua`):** Added `biodegradable-capsule` unlock directly to the baseline `pneumatic-transport` technology. Created the `specialized-pneumatic-capsules` technology node (prerequisite: `pneumatic-transport`, 250 cycles @ 30s) to unlock `refrigerated-capsule`, `reinforced-capsule`, and `player-transit-capsule`.
