### Revision: Purge Non-Serializable Lua Functions from Persistent Storage
**Date:** 2026-09-14 22:36 EDT
**Context:** Factorio autosaves were failing with an engine-level `on_save()` non-recoverable error caused by Lua function references stored directly in persistent `storage` tables. This session neutralized legacy heap comparator closures and enforced string-only callback identifiers across all timed motion flight records.
**Key Changes:**
1. **Storage Setup Migration (`control.lua`):** Stripped legacy `comparator` functions from active binary heaps (`spoil_heap`, `timed_arrival_heap`, `kinetic_arrival_heap`) and cleared function callbacks from `timed_flight_records` during `setup_storage()`.
2. **Heap Attachment Sanitization (`scripts/utils/binary-heap.lua`):** Added explicit `heap.comparator = nil` inside `binary_heap.attach` to neutralize lingering legacy comparator functions upon deserialization with zero runtime overhead.
3. **Flight Record Hardening (`scripts/utils/timed-motion.lua`):** Enforced string-only typing on `on_arrival` specifications in `timed_motion.create_record`, permanently preventing function closures from entering `storage.timed_flight_records`.
4. **Arrival Dispatch Resolution (`scripts/capsules/capsule-ballistics.lua`):** Updated `handle_timed_arrival` to resolve string `on_arrival` keys through the registered arrival handler table.
