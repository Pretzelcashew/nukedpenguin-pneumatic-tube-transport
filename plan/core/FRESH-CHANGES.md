### Revision: Hardened Mod Packager and Release Export Manifest
**Date:** 2026-09-11 19:48 EDT
**Context:** Hardened the automated release packager against accidental configuration file omission and established explicit build-safety protocols for external drive packaging.
**Key Changes:**
1. **Mod Packaging Pipeline (`package.py`):** Extended `EXPORT.md` resolution to search `plan/core/` before root and destination fallbacks, added an interactive `(y/N)` execution gate when rules are absent, and documented multi-drive synchronization requirements.
2. **Release Export Manifest (`plan/core/EXPORT.md`):** Relocated active release exclusion rules out of archive staging into `plan/core/`, adding explicit anti-archival headers, script usage warnings, and cross-drive sync directives.


### Revision: Modularize Flow Engine into Renderer and Gate Interoperability Subsystems
**Date:** 2026-09-11 22:20 EDT
**Context:** Decomposed the monolithic 2,511-line `flow-engine.lua` into isolated domain modules to decouple Alt-Mode visual rendering and defensive structure interoperability from core wavefront graph simulation.
**Key Changes:**
1. **Flow Overlay Renderer (`scripts/flow/flow-renderer.lua`):** Extracted all Alt-Mode graphical drawing routines (`draw_circle`, `draw_line`, `draw_text`), visual color palettes, dominant pressure and counter query primitives, and per-player render registries (`storage.flow_renders`, `storage.counter_renders`, `storage.kinetic_renders`, `storage.flow_edge_renders`).
2. **Fence & Gate Interoperability Engine (`scripts/flow/flow-gate-interop.lua`):** Encapsulated stone-wall dual-channel orthogonal axis locking (`storage.wall_locked_group`), terminator gate state tracking and outer boundary containment cutoff sync (`storage.gate_cutoff_states`), pre-research soft-registry discovery (`storage.soft_interop_registry`), and throttled research activation queue drainage (`storage.interop_activation_queue`).
3. **Wavefront Graph Simulation Core (`scripts/flow/flow-engine.lua`):** Reduced core file size by over 1,700 lines down to ~720 lines by aliasing visual primitives to `flow-renderer` and delegating defensive structure lifecycle handlers to `flow-gate-interop` while strictly preserving public API signatures and 0-tick idle queue execution.


### Revision: Modularize Kinetic Flow and Centralize Shared Graph Primitives
**Date:** 2026-09-11 23:36 EDT
**Context:** Decomposed the flow engine into dedicated domain modules and extracted a shared graph foundation in `flow-common.lua` to eliminate duplicate waking loops and resolve a scope-shadowing wavefront stall.
**Key Changes:**
1. **Shared Flow Foundation (`scripts/flow/flow-common.lua`):** Established a low-level base module containing the single source of truth for capsule waking (`wake_port_parked`), queue management (`enqueue_port`), spatial coordinate hashing, and atomic graph mutations (`destroy_node`, `link_ports`, `sever_ports`) to prevent circular dependency hazards and code duplication.
2. **Kinetic Projection Engine (`scripts/flow/flow-kinetic.lua`):** Encapsulated electromagnetic projector beam projection, discrete line-of-sight obstacle queries, receiver catchment, and 5-tile ballistic hop chains while delegating graph mutations and waking calls to `flow-common`.
3. **Wavefront Simulation Core (`scripts/flow/flow-engine.lua`):** Resolved local scope shadowing of `flow_changed` and `range_changed` inside the step loop that stalled pressure propagation across tubes, decoupled gas pressure from `storage.kinetic_levels`, and broadened neighbor waking across all flow changes.
4. **Alt-Mode Overlay Renderer (`scripts/flow/flow-renderer.lua`):** Filtered dominant pressure port evaluations to ignore kinetic nodes, preventing open-air kinetic beam reach levels from rendering as gas pressure numbers or cyan circles.
